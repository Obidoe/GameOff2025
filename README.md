# Algorithm Tower Defense
Algorithm Tower Defense is a 2D top-down tower defense game where you must defeat waves of viruses before they can take over your system. Buy specially crafted towers built with different problem solving algorithms to fight off three different types of enemies which each employ a different pathfinding algorithm.
This game was made by Group 10 (Zac Adams, Harry Rai, and Jasraj Gosal) for our COMP 359 final project and the 2025 GitHub Game Off https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2025. 
This game was made in python using pygame-ce.
